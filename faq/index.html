  There are a lot of questions to be had with FPV, if you're starting out or not. We hope to have the most commolny asked ones answered here! <br>
  The questions will be sorted into general categories, and there is an index that will help you find what you're looking for <br>
  If not, contact me through my socials, or on discord, and I will do my best to add it here, and if not, at least try to answer it <br><br>

    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">C Rating - </span>Used to calculate the max charge/discharge current of the battery. How it's calculated, and more on battery theory is answered bellow in Building</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">S Rating - </span>How many cells are in series. One cell has a max voltage of 4.2V, with a 3.7V nominal. So a 4S battery will have a max voltage of 16.8V for example. 
      Series "adds" together the max voltage of batteries</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">P Rating - </span>How many cells are in parallel. A 4S2P battery will have 8 cells, four in series, two of the 4S batteries in parallel. 
      Parallel "adds" together the capacity of batteries</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">OSD - </span>On Screen Display. Most often right on the FC, the video get's passed through it, with the OSD information overlayed on it, and then sent out to the VTX</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">AUX - </span>Auxilary port. Name for a control channel that isn't in the four main ones - Throttle, Yaw, Pitch, Roll</li>

    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Analog - The original way of transmitting FPV video on quads. At first, car back-up and security cameras were used, the signal is carried as analog is very much like old TV!<br>
      Still using the NTSC/PAL standards, it's cheaper to use, integrate, and transcode</span></li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Digital - Newer systems, coming out from DJI and Fatshark with sharkbyte, with some open source projects as well. <br>
      The video quality is higher, at the cost of some latency. The level of latency differs from system, with Sharkbyte being the fastest, and OpenHD being one of the highest, DJI in the middle. <br>
      The signal is carried by ones and zeros, and it's a much newer technology for FPV quads, making the hardware more expensive</span></li>

</div>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="numbers">What do all the numbers and values mean?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>There is a lot of numbers when speccing out a quad, anywhere from props, to the FC, to the VTX. And you should know what most of them mean</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Props - </span>Usually four, five numbers (with some exceptions). For example a 5130 prop will be 5.0" blade length and 3.0" pitch, a 3016 prop will be 3" blade length and 1.6" pitch, 
      a 51433 prop will be 5.1" blade length, and 4.33" pitch. With the exception being HQ, they name their props like 5x3.6x3, 
      which stands for 5" blade length, 3.6" pitch, and 3 blades. Some manufacurers (Ethix, and just recently Gemfan)also just use a letter and a number for the name, 
      and you'll have to find the length and pitch yourself</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">FC - </span>Most often specced out with an F or H series processor, such as F405, F722, or H743. In order of least to most performance, it's: F303, F411. F405, F722. F745, F765, 
        and H743. FC's can also be rated for a specific voltage, or voltage range, such as 1s, 2-4s, or 2-6s</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">ESC - </span>Usually you'll see two ratings, the max current draw per ESC, like 40A, and max/min cell voltage, same as the FC above</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">VTX - </span>Rated for output power, frequency, and input voltage (also the same as an FC). Usually the power can be anywhere from 25mw to 1000mw+ on some high output ones. 
      Usually more power lleads to beter range and penetrastion, but that can only go so far, and that's where frequency comes into play. 
      Most VTX's now are 5.8GHz, but you can find ones that go on 2.4GHz, and 1.3GHz</li>
    <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Camera - </span>Really only just TVL. TVL stands for TV Lines, as it's used to measure analog resolution. Usually the more, the better, with most modern ones coming at our above 1200TVL</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="cost">What does it cost to get into FPV?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This all just depends on the budget that you have. FPV can get pretty expensive pretty damn fast, so you should know what you're getting into. <br>
    A good rule of thumb is to not get anything you can't immediately afford to get replacement parts.<br>
    <ul>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="charging">How to charge and take care for batteries?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>Batteries can very quickly go up in flames if you don't care for them properly. The chances of that are almost zero if you just take some safety precautions. 
    There are charger and battery recommendations down the line, so you should have a good base of what to get.<br> When you first get your charger, it is a good idea to calibrate it, 
    if you have a multimeter. <br>When it comes to charging, you should set the charger to the correct battery type, for most FPV batteries that will be LiPo. 
    The charger should show 4.2V maximum voltage. Enter in your cell count, and then get the charge current in.<br>
    As talked about above, the C rating is used to calcualte the current going in/out of the battery. 
    The calculation is Capacity(Ah)×C=A. So for a 1300mah battery charging at 1C, you would set the charge current to 1.3A (1.3Ah×1C=1.3A), 
    for a 1500mah battery charging at 2C it would be 3A (1.5A×2C=3A), etc...<br>
    Plug in the battery, with both the main xt60 connector, and the balance plug into their respective portson the charger. You can then start the charge. 
    At 1C, a full charge should take about an hour. 1C is the optimal charge current, but if need be, you can go higher. 
    This shouldn't damage the battery all that much, but it is always better to charge at 1C.

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="flight-modes-difference">What is the difference between flight modes?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>There are three main ones that you should be familiar with. Angle, Horizon, and Acro<br>
    <ul>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight"></span>Angle - The radio stick position changes the angle of the quad depending on how it was set up, so a full stick forward on pitch will tilt the quad, say, 30 degrees forwards, and not more. 
        When the stick is returned to center, the quad should too</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight"></span>Horizon - Acts like angle mode, but after a certain stick threshold, it will switch to acro, and when bought back, it will switch back to how angle mode works</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight"></span>Acro - The stick position dictates how fast the quad will spin at that axis. This can be changed with rates, changing how fast it will spin, or even the movement curve</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="flight-modes">What flight mode to start with?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>If you are flying a tinywhoop inside, or don't yet feel comfortable with acro, you can fly with angle, as it is easier to manage the speed. <br>
    Horizon should pretty much be avoided completely. <br>And pretty much in every other situation you should be flying acro.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="sims">What are some good sims to start with?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This depends on how much you want to spend, but all of the ones that I'll suggest are under $20. On the lowest end, there is CurryKitten sim, which can run on a potato. 
    Then for the paid ones, there are only a few that I'd recommend. Velocidrone and Liftoff. Liftoff has better graphics, but Velocidrone has overall better performance, 
    and much more realistic controls. If you're on a console, I'd recommend DCL.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible starting-transition content" id="get-good">How long does it take to "get good"?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This can be different for anyone. For some, acro mode, and just flying fpv in general feels like second nature in the first few hours, someone else might need tens of hours in a sim to start feeling confident.<br>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What tools do I need? </button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>No matter if you are building a quad, getting one pre-made, or anything between, you will need tools to fix it/actually build it. 
    There are a lot of tools you'll need, some more needed than others. To get you started just get a prop tool, a soldering iron, and a set of 1.5mm-3mmhex drivers. 
    That should be good enough for the time being. <br><br>You might then also want tweezers (or forceps) to hold wires when soldering, 
    nut wrenches to get nuts out of harder-to-reach places, and maybe some helping hands for holding boards when soldering, as well as a multimeter to measure for continuity, 
    a smoke stopper to make sure that you won't put your new build in danger if you mess something up</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What kind of quad should I get?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>All just depends on what you want to do. There are quads you can build ranging anywhere from a little thing that fits in your palm, and can be safely flown almost anywhere, 
    up to copters that can lift cinema-grade cameras. <br><br>
    
    For general use, a 5" quad is probably your best bet, you can either get a race, freestyle, ultralight, or a cinematic quad 
    (use is kinda self explanatory). The main difference between those is that freestyle frames are heavier, and more durable than racing frames, 
    and cinematic frames will have props out of view of the camera.<br><br>
  
    There are also cinewhoops, which are protected 3" quads that can be safely flown around other people, while still carrying an action camera. 
    You can also get a bunch of different 3" quads, usually in the same "categories" as 5" mentioned above. These are great if you have less space, or don't need to carry a GoPro.
    Or just get a little tinywhoop, those are usually only flown indoors (or outside if there is absolutely no wind).<br><br>

    If you really feel like stepping it up, get a 7" quad that can carry heavier batteries, and fly for much longer with the same payload. 
    Or take it even further, and get a cinelifter. These quads should only be used by professionals though, and the price reflects that as well.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">How to choose compatible parts?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>There are a couple of things you need to look out for when choosing compatible parts. We're lucky that a lot of the stuff out there is compatible with each other, 
    but there are also some exceptions. As long as you read carefully, you should be fine with compatibility<br><br>
  
    The main things you should always look for is if your frame would fit the FC/ESC/VTX, as well as all the other parts you might put in. 
    Camera size is also important to make sure you get right. There are pre-established size standards though, so that makes it a bit easier. 
    Cameras are (from biggest to smallest): Full-size (28x28), Mini (21x21), Micro (19x19), Nano (14x14), and Pico (12x12). 
    For FC's/ESC's/VTX's, it's (again from biggest to smallest, the numbers are in mm): 30x30 (full), 25x25 (whoop mount), 20x20 (micro), and 16x16 (nano)
    Same goes for motors. There are motors that have screw spacing of different sizes, and you need to make sure that it will fit what your frane has.<br><br>

    There is also electronical compatibility. Some parts can only take a certain voltage, and some need specific ports on your FC.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">How to choose parts for a specific build</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This varies from quad to quad, and there aren't many things that stay constant. But for example, on a 5" quad, you'd be looking at 2207/2208/2306/2307 sized motors, 
    probably a 30x30, 25x25, or a 20x20 stack, a mini or micro camera, and 4s or 6s batteries. <br>
    For a 3" quad the motors change a lot depending on the use, but you'd have a 25x25 or a 20x20 stack, and a micro camera. <br>
    As you get lower in size, you will need smaller and smaller parts, so for a whoop you'd have 0802 motors, a 25x25 AIO, and a pico camera
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content" id="solder">How to solder?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
<p>First off you should get an adjustable-tempreature soldering iron, because you want to have control over the tempreature. 
  I prefer ~380C for regular stuff, ~420C for bigger joints, like battery or motor pads. Get some good rosin core leaded solder, either 60/40 or 63/37. 
  If you don't know which brands to choose from, TBS solder is a good pick. Also helps to have a cleaning sponge or cleaning brass wool, 
  and some flux. Doesnt matter if it's the paste, gel, or pen type, all work great to make it much easier and cleaner<br><br>

  Start by tinning the tip, which makes the heat transfer much easier. Apply flux to the pad(s) you will be soldering to. Get the iron on the pad, heat it up for a short while, 
  and push the tin wire under the soldering iron tip. Pull out the iron, and check if it looks good. You should have a round, shiny "dome" of solder on the pad. 
  If it isn't shiny, try higher tempreature or a bit more flux, if it isn't round try to add more solder.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What should I get as spares?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>Usually the parts that get broken the most are the ones that are outside of the main body of the frame. So definetly get a spare motor or two, a spare camera 
    (or just a camera lens if you know the specific one you need), a spare VTX and receiver antenna, and maybe some spare bolts if you strip or bend one in a crash.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What accessories to get?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>There are many things that can help you throughout building/fixing/flying quads. You should always have zipties, heatshrink, and electrical/kepton/fabric tape. 
    A silicone work mat goes a long way to protect whatever is underneath, and also make organisation a bit easier. 
    For extra organisation, get a parts tray, or straight up one of those drawer racks for various little bits and bobs that you might need.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">How to best mount a vtx antenna?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>Most frames nowadays come with some kind of mount that either holds a regular SMA connector, or one of the "Unify" style ones with the two holes on either side. 
    I Highly prefer those over the normal ones, because the round ones tend to spin and damge themselves when you tighten them. 
    The unify ones prevent that when also screwed in with the two m3 holes. If you have the option to use those, defiently use them instead.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">How to best mount a receiver antenna?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This depends on what you want to do, and what kind of antenna you have. 
    For normal 2.4ghz whisker antennas, having them on zipties pointing back from the front arms is usually the way to do it.
    For 900mhz "immortal T" antennas, you can either have it on the amr, in the back, or in the front with a holder. For best range it's better to have it in the front, 
    but that can make it less durable. In the back it's the safest, and on the arm it's the easiest.
    For the new 2.4ghz "mini T" antennas, it's almost the same as the 900mhz ones, but since they're smaller, you can fit them in more places, 
    so you can get pretty creative with the way you mount them
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What KV should I get for my build?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>For a 5", generally it's about 1700-1900kv for 6s, and then 2400-2700kv for 4s. But obviously there are more factors at play. 
    If you're building a lighter quad, it's better to go with high kv motors and low pitch props, and for a heavier quad go with lower kv and higher pitch props. 
    For smaller quads, there can be so much variation that you should probably look at examples of what you are building</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-building building-transition content">What kind of battery should I get?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>CNHL, GNB, Tattu (and their respective OEMs) are all good batteries, 
    CNHL being the best in value, GNB are all round great performers, and Tattu are usually for high current/low weight setups.
    As for the specs, again this also depends on the size of the quad and cell count, but for a 5" it's about 1000-1300mah for a 6s battery, 
    1300-1500mah for 4s, all ideally at or above 100C. With quads smaller than that, it depends on what kind of quad it is, 
    so again, look at examples of what other people built,and/or experiment yourself (within reason ;) )</p>

<h2  id="betaflight" class="content page-header bf-header betaflight" >Betaflight</h2>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">Betaflight won't connect to my FC, what to do?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>There is a few reasons this can happen. Some USB Micro B cables only supply power, not data, so that would be the first thing I'd check. Next step would be installing the drivers. 
    The ones needed are listed in Betaflight Configurator, but there is <a class="link" href="https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe"> a tool</a> 
    that can install all the ones that are needed in one step. Run that, plug in your FC, follow the instructions, and it should be all fixed.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">How to flash the FC?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>Before flashing anything, it's always good to make a backup. So go into the CLI, type <code class="code">diff all</code> and press enter. 
    This will list out all the settings that were changed from bone stock Betaflight. you can then save the file with the buttons at the bottom, and then you can load it in<br><br>
    <code class="code">!!! Don't just randomly load in diff files from a much older version of betaflight, as this can make problems, especially with the PID settings, those received a lot of changes in 4.2 !!!</code><br><br>
    Once you have this file, you can go ahead and flash it. The diff file contains all the info you need. At the top, it will have something like this:<br><code class="code">
       # diff all <br>
       # version <br>
       # Betaflight / STM32F411 (S411) 4.2.0 Jun 14 2020 / 03:04:43 (8f2d21460) MSP API: 1.43 <br>
       # config: YES <br>
       # start the command batch <br>
       batch start <br>
       # reset configuration to default settings <br>
       defaults nosave <br>
       board_name HGLRCF411 <br>
       manufacturer_id HGLR <br>
       mcu_id 004900423439510f37393937 <br>
       signature 
      </code><br>
    You care about the <code class="code">board_name</code> as that will be the target you select when flashing. Click on the <code class="code">Update Firmware</code> button, 
    and set your parameters there. Don't touch most of the stuff, you just need to select the board target, the version you want to flash, and to do full chip erase. 
    Then, once you have all that set, you can click <code class="code">Load Firmware (Online)</code> and that will download the firmware. Then once you have all that, 
    you can actually click <code class="code">Flash Firmware</code> If everything goes as it should, the bar should slowly load, and when fully loaded, 
    should show up as green, and say that the flashing was successful
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">How to set up a receiver</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This does depend on what receiver you have, but there are some things that stay the same. If you connected it up according to the manual, you just enable <code class="code">serial rx</code>
    under the UART that youconnected it to, and then in the configuration tab, there is a receiver section. There, you want to select the output protocol that your receiver does.
    For FrSky, that is SBUS (or F.Port if you set that up), Crossfire does CRSF, IRC Ghost is GHST, and FlySky is IBUS. Once that is done, you should have input in the receiver tab. <br><br>
    There are some things you want to change there too though. Mainly the channel order, and the RSSi channel if you're runnin a receiver that has RSSi on an aux channel. 
    The channel order can be different from TX to TX, so you might want to look your specific one, or just change the order of the letters until it does match up with the stick input
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">How to set up SmartAudio</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>First step is to find out what SA version your VTX supports. The manufacturer will often have this listed on their website, or on the product listing itself. 
    Once you have that, you can load in a generic VTX table for that version, and then modify the values if needed, stuff like output power, and maybe the channels if they are missing. <br><br>
    The other way is much easier. Some bigger manufacturers will have VTX tables ready for download for the specific VTX, so you just load that in, and it should work.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">How to set up GPS and return to home functionality?</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>It is pretty easy to set up basic GPS, but dialing in RTH settings might be more difficult. To get GPS working, you just need to wire it up correctly to a spare UART on the FC. 
    Then in betaflight, in the ports tabunder that UART you want to select GPS in the Sensors dropdown, and keep the baud rate as is. Most oft he actual setup is done in the configuration tab. 
    There, enable GPS, set the protocol to UBLOX (NMEA if UBLOX isn't working), enable autoconfig, and you can enable auto baud rate, 
    but ideally you should have this value from the manufacturer <br><br>
    As for RTH, this can be up to preference, like how fast it should return, how high should it go before returing, etc... All of these settings are in the Failsafe tab. 
    First you need to enable GPS RTH Failsafe, and then you can set your parameters. These are as follows: <br>
    <ul>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Minimum Satellites - </span>How many sats are needed beforet he quad can even arm. Once this value is higher than what you set, 
        the quad will be ready to arm. Usually it's better to have it above 6, but the more, the better.</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Altitude Mode - </span>Will change how the altitude is used to return back home. <br>
          Maximum altitude will use the highest altitude that the quad was in during the flight. <br> Fixed value is just a simple height in meters. <br> 
          And current altitude will just head straight back without climbing up</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Initial Altitude (meters) - </span>The height the quad will go to before returing. You want this to be high enough to avoid all obstacles, but low enough where it's still in range.</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Descent distance (meters) - </span>At what distance from the set home point the quad will go down. Set this to where you would be able to get back into the TX range.</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Angle - </span>At which angle the quad will tilt forward when going home.</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Ground speed (meters/second) - </span>How fast the quad will go in relation to the ground. Keep in mind that this is in m/s.</li>
      <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Throttle Min/Max/Hover - </span>The throttle channel values it will use for the whole RTH process. Keep Min high enough thaht the props spin fast enough, 
        keep Max low enough so that it isn't too fast, and set hover to the approximate value that the quad will hover at</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible-bf bf-transition content">My motors won't stop spinning after zero throttle</button>
<div class="collapsible-content faq-collapsible content">
  <p>This is called I Term Windup. The quad will want to have control over it's movement 100% of the time. If it can't move, it'll add throttle constantly to try and move itself. So it keeps adding more and more until you disarm.</p>
