text: If you want a small game-pad style radio, with top-end build quality, this
  is the one to go for. A large internal battery, and integrated crossfire for
  those who already run it. TBS make good quality stuff, but for users who don't
  already run crossfire, it is recommended to get an ELRS module, even though
  you'd be limited to 250Hz
price: $159.95
