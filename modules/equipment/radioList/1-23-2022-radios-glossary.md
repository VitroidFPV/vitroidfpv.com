  ### Protocol:


  More detail about compatibility is [in the FAQ](https://vitroidfpv.com/faq#compatibleRadio). Slightly different here, as for the most part, I listed the actual RF tech used in the radios


  * CC2500 - The main chip used in FrSky radios, used for ACCST transmission

  * 4in1 - A collection of the 4 chips used in nearly all 2.4GHz Radio controllers, allowing you to bind it to pretty much anything. FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum, Futaba, and a [lot more](https://www.multi-module.org/basics/supported-protocols)

  * ELRS - Also in more detail in the FAQ, it's an open-source, long-range, high-performance link, and IMO the best option going forward


  ### Gimbals:


  Refers to the sensor type used to get the angle of the stick, we mainly see these two used:


  * Pot - Potentiometer, relies on physical contact to measure, susceptible to wear

  * Hall - Hall Effect sensors, use magnets to measure. It should practically last forever


  ### Module bays:


  The slot in the back of the radio where you can put a TX module. Higher output power, protocols that the radio itself is incapable of. There are mainly two standard-ish sizes:


  * JR (Full-size/Micro) - An older standard. physically larger, so more room to fit cooling, more features like an external screen, etc...

  * Lite (Nano) - First introduced on the FrSky X-Lite radio, a more compact option for smaller radios. Less available options and the smaller space
