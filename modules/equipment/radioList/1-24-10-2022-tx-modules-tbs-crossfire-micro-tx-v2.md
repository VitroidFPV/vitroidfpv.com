text: The original go-to protocol for anything long-range, and the best option
  to get Crossfire compatibility. Fits into most radios with the JR bay, and 1W
  output will give you comparable range to ELRS... and that's the thing. I
  wouldn't recommend the TBS systems for new users unless you're already in the
  ecosystem
