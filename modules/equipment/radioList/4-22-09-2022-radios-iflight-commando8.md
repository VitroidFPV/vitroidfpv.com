text: IFlight makes good BNF quads... their entry into the radio market was a
  pretty big surprise. It had a rough start, but now everything is fixed. It's
  made to be easy to transport. Compact switches, folding antenna, and removable
  sticks that don't jut out, it makes for a good travel radio
