text: Hands down the best entry-level radio on the market right now. This is it if you're after an inexpensive but still fully featured ELRS radio. It's great! It's better than pretty much everything in this group, maybe except the Zorro, it even has fancy colors available. <b>Please get this if nothing else!</b>
