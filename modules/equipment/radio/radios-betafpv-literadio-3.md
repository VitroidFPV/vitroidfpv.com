text: Likely the cheapest you can get without it being absolute crap. Decent
  build quality and upgraded gimbals from the original LR2 (SE). I'd recommend
  going up to some of the following picks, but it'll do if you're on a very
  tight budget. But keep in mind that it doesn't run standard software
# price: $59.99
# point1: "Protocol: ELRS/FrSky"
# point2: "Gimbals: Pot"
# point3: "Output: 100mW"
# point4: "Module bay: Lite"
# point5: "Weight: ???"
