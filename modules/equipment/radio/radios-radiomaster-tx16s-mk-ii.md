text: The radio to end all radios, if you want the top of of the top, this is
  the one to get. A large color touch screen, all the switches and pots you'd
  ever need, faster charging and better ergonomics from the original, and
  amazing build quality make this radio very futureproof and versatile for not
  only quadcopters
