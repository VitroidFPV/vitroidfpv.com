text: A collaboration between Eachine and Radiomaster, they made a surprisingly
  good radio. Externally adjustable hall gimbals, pretty much the same feature
  set as the more expensive TX16S MK II, but with a price much closer to when
  the OG TX16S first came out. Less available, but the price may make up for
  that
price: $177.99
