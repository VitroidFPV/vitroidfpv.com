text: The larger sibling to the Tango2, like the TX12, but more premium. Focused
  on giving users the features of full-size radios in a small form factor.
  Full-size module bay and plenty of switches...  and Tracer internally. That's
  my main gripe with it, as it's just not that great. Same as with the Tango,
  I'd suggest going the ELRS route
