text: Back to lower prices again, the Jumper AION is a very affordable module
  for Lite bays, great if you want to upgrade a small radio to ELRS at an
  affordable price. You also get a screen to also give you full external
  control, a rarity at this price. But you only get 500mW of output power
price: $29.99
point1: "Freq: 2.4GHz"
