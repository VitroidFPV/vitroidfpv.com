text: Similar to ELRS (and other modern radio systems), Tracer is running on
  2.4GHz but uses a different modulation, called FLRC. This offers it higher
  update rates up to 250Hz, and range up to about ~5km (both still lower than
  ELRS). So similarly to Crossfire, I would not recommend it to new pilots
