text: If you want a small game-pad style radio, with top-end build quality, this is the one to go for. A large internal battery, and integrated crossfire for those who already run it. TBS make good quality stuff, but for users who don't already run crossfire, it is recommended to get an ELRS module, even though you'd be limited to 250Hz
