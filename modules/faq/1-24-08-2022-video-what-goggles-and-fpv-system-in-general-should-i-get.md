title: What goggles and FPV system in general should I get?
id: fpvSystem
answer: >-
  ###### As of the date of me writing this (24. 8. 2022), DJI is set to release
  a brand new FPV system as a successor to their original one, and Walksnail is
  just getting started. Due to this, the recommendations given below may not be
  accurate in the future


  The thing that matters the most is your budget and realistic expectations. You can get decent analog goggles as cheap as $80, but most digital systems start at over $400 just for the goggles, and then you still need an expensive camera + VTX along with it. Analog may seem low quality, but unless you really cheap out, it shouldn't bother you much


  * If you're just starting out, or getting into racing and don't want to spend much, you can get some cheaper analog goggles like the Eachine EV800D, or Skyzone Cobra S/X. They still provide all the needed features without being too expensive

  * If you have decided that you want to stay on analog for the foreseable future, or want to use a digital VRX like HDZero, you might want to get a good pair of slimline goggles. Fatshark Attitude V6, Skyzone 02o, and Eachine EV300o (just skyzone goggles re-branded) at the lower end, Skyzone 04L/04X, Orqa FPV.one goggles at the top end

  * If you want quality digital video, and don't mind a bit of latency, without question go to DJI Digital. They have some drawbacks, like a hard limit on the range (~13.5km IIRC), and limited support for Betaflight OSD, but both of these can be fixed with semi-official or unofficial firmware fixes for both Betaflight and the goggles themselves

  * If you still want good quality video, but still want the lowest latency, HDZero is the best option. The way the system works makes the video fall off much closer to analog than other digital systems, and since the video isn't compressed, you get very low latency as well

  * Walksnail is just getting started, and some people already claim it is comparable to, or better than DJI in some ways. But for other people (as of the time of writing, see above) it's supposedly unusable. Right now my only suggestion is to only buy it if you are willing to actively test and update the system with some bugs along the way
