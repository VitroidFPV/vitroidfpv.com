title: I'm getting a gray screen with OSD in my goggles
id: grayScreen
answer: >-
  On analog systems, this is most often caused by the FC getting blank video
  from the camera, and only overlaying the OSD on top, then sending that to the
  VTX, this may be caused by a few reasons:


  * Camera video output is disconnected/damaged, in dire situations, you can solder directly to the plug

  * Camera is not getting power

  * The FC video input is damaged, in dire situations you may be able to connect the camera video to the OSD chip video input
