  Whether you like it or not, soldering is an essential part of the hobby. Stuff
  breaks and you have to fix it. Good equipment and know-how go a long way to
  help with the process, so let's get into that:


  You will need a decent soldering iron, most cheap ones aren't worth the trouble. I have some good ones listed elsewhere on the site. Flux, solder, side cutters, and tweezers are all must-haves IMO, a silicon mat and helping hands/blutac also help. Prepare all your items:


  * Start by setting the iron to \~370°C for smaller joints, \~420°C for larger ones (this goes for most "cheaper" irons as they usually cannot supply enough heat, if you have a good/more expensive one, you'll likely be fine in the lower range)

  * Clean the soldering iron tip with a wet sponge or brass wool, and slightly tin it

  * Clean off the PCB if it's dirty, ideally with IPA or distilled water

  * Get the PCB fixed in place


  ##### Now to the actual soldering:


  1. If your flux isn't solid, apply it to the pads

  2. Tin the whole pad. Ideally, the iron shouldn't melt the solder. It should heat up the pad, and the pad should melt the solder. But if you use it to melt it, it's not a big issue

  3. Once it's tinned, it should look shiny, smooth, and round. If it's not, you likely need more heat and/or flux

  4. Expose, twist, and tin the wire (you should only leave enough wire exposed to match the length of the pad). Flux may often help. Again, heat up the exposed part of the wire, and ideally apply the solder to the wire, not the soldering iron

  5. Bring the tinned wire to the pad, melt the solder blob on the pad, and insert the wire. Don't push on the wire with the soldering iron as that can fray the end

  6. Make sure the pad stays round-ish after it's solidified, and that the exposed end of the wire isn't sticking out

  7. Optionally clean the board after finishing all of the joints with IPA or distilled water to get rid of residual flux
