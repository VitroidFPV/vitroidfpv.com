  On analog systems, this is most often caused by the VTX transmitting an empty
  signal, which can be caused by a few reasons:


  * The video wire for the VTX is damaged/disconnected

  * The FC video output is damaged, this can in dire situations be fixed by soldering directly to the OSD chip video output

  * The VTX video input is damaged, likely unfixable

  * Can also sometimes happen from a PAL/NTSC mismatch
