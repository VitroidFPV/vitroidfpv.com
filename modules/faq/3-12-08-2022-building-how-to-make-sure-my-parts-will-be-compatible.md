title: How to check for mechanical compatibility?

  We're lucky that a lot of the stuff out there is compatible and standardized,
  but there are also some exceptions and weird off-spec things. As long as you
  read carefully, you should be fine. As compatibility is hard to get in a
  single answer, they have been split


  ##### Mounting sizes:


  * There are different sizes for FCs/ESCs, cameras, motors, and props

  * For FC/ESC, there are three main sizes. 30.5mm x 30.5mm (or 30x30 in short), 20mm x 20mm, and 25.5mm x 25mm for AIOs. This is where the biggest differences arise, as manufacturers seem to disagree on what size it should be. There are sizes anywhere from 25mm to 26.5mm. They should be largely compatible if soft mounted, but it's something to watch out for

  * Cameras are likely one of the most standardized components. Going down in size, it's: Full size (28mm x 28mm), Mini (21x21), DJI (20x20), Micro (19x19), Nano (14x14), and sometimes Pico (12x12). There are some outliers, mostly in the smallest sizes, but those are usually well documented

  * The motor stator size usually doesn't matter much for compatibility in mounting, but the motor base mounting pattern does. For most motors, it's 4 screws in a square pattern, measured across (or as a circle measured as its diameter, see image): 19mm (7" quads), 16mm (5" quads), 12mm (Ultralight 5" or heavier3", 4" quads), 9mm ( 3-4" toothpicks), and in a triangle pattern, with the holes spaced 6.6mm apart for whoops/tiny <2" quads

  * Props obviously differ in blade size and pitch, but we mainly care about the mounting type, as I assume you know to put 5" props on a 5" frame. There are different ways to mount props, depending on the motor and craft size. Most full-size 5" quads and heavier 3-4" quads will use an M5 threaded shaft (as shown in the image above), lighter 5" quads and smaller will use T-Mount (a 1.5 or 2mm shaft with two m2 holes on each side), and tinywhoops/<2" quads may use only a push-on 1 or 1.5mm shaft
