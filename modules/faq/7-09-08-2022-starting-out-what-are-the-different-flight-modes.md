title: What are the different flight modes?
id: flightModes
answer: >-
  There are four main ones that you should be familiar with. Angle, Horizon,
  Acro, and Acro Trainer


  * Angle - The radio stick position changes the angle of the quad, so a full stick forward on pitch will tilt the quad, say, 30 degrees forwards, and not more. When the stick is returned to center, the quad should too

  * Horizon - Acts like angle mode, but after a certain stick threshold, it will switch to acro, and when bought back, it will switch back to how angle mode works, allowing flips

  * Acro - The stick position dictates how fast the quad will spin at that axis. This can be changed with rates, changing how fast it will spin at a set point of the stick travel. Only active when no other flight mode is set

  * Acro Trainer - Functionally the same as acro, but won't tilt further than set, basically the best of both angle and acro


  It is recommended to start with Acro or Acro trainer, as that's the most common and most controllable option. For tinywhoops, angle and/or horizon may be useful, but that's an exception
