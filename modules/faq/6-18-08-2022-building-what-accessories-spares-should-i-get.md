  There are many things that you may or may not need throughout
  building/fixing/flying quads. Some odd accessory bits here and there will make
  the job easier, and you will always need some spares in case something beaks


  ##### Accessories:


  * Zipties are always really good to have, pretty much everything can be quickly tied down, held in place, or supported. Get a 100+ pack, and you'll be set for a good while

  * Nuts and bolts in various sizes. M2 and M3 are the most common sizes used, and they're pretty much always good to have on hand

  * Heatshrink and/or electrical tape. Always insulate your wire connections, so as to not make anything short out. Also good to hold other things in place


  ##### Spares:


  * Basically everything in the quad will eventually break, the things outside of the main "body" will tend to break much more easily as they're more exposed

  * Motors, props, and arms mainly, you should always have at least one of each on hand to fix up after a crash

  * VTX and receiver antennas, VTX pigtails are also likely to break in a hard crash and are pretty crucial for the quad to work

  * Then all of the other things in the quad. You don't have to keep a spare of each electronic part, but keeping a bunch of 20-30AWG wire to fix snapped wires is a good idea
