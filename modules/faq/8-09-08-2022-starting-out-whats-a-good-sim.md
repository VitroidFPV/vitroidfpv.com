  There are a few good sims to recommend, both free and paid, for PC and
  console:


  * [Velocidrone](https://www.team-blacksheep.com/simulator) - Best realistic physics and most used (PC, $20)

  * [Liftoff ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/410340/Liftoff_FPV_Drone_Racing/)- Decent physics, supports Steam workshop and has decent graphics (PC and Console, $20)

  * [Uncrashed ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1682970/Uncrashed__FPV_Drone_Simulator/)- Great graphics, ok physics (PC, $13)

  * [Orqa FPV.SkyDive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1278060/FPVSkyDive__FPV_Drone_Racing__Freestyle_Simulator/) - Likely the best free sim out there, with decent graphics and physics for the price (PC, Free)

  * [DCL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/964570/DCL__The_Game/) - An "official" sim for the Drone Champions League ($30, PC and Console)
  
  * [DRL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator/) - Official sim of the Drone Racing League, physics OK but can be adjusted. Tournaments almost daily and custom quads can be built (PC, $9)
