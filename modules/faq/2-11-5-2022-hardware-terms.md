title: What do the hardware terms mean?
id: hardwareTerms
order: 2
answer: • Quad - Short for quadcopter, it's a way to specify what kind of
  drone/UAV the craft is. There's also Hex, Octo, and Tri for more specific
  drone types with 6, 8, and 3 motors respecively<br> • FC - Flight Controller,
  the brains of the quad. Takes control over all the signals that the drone
  needs to fly<br> • ESC - Electronic Speed Controller, what makes the motors
  run. The FC sends info to it how to spin each of the motors as it needs<br> •
  RX/TX - Receiver/Transmitter, used when refferring to the hardware parts on
  the quad, the goggles/transmitter(radio) for the pilot, or connections on the
  FC<br> • VTX/VRX - Video transmitter/receiver, used for video transmission on
  the drone and reception in the goggles, some have it integrated, some have it
  external<br> • LiPo/Li-Ion - Lithium Polymer and Lithium Ion batteries, types
  of batteries we use. LiPos for higher discharge rate aplications, Li-Ion for
  higher capacity<br> • XT30/60/90 - The main battery connectors we use. XT30 on
  micros, xt60 on normal size quads, and xt90 on larger, more demaning crafts •
  PSU - Power Supply Unit, the power source for your charger if it doesn't have
  one integrated. Steps down 110/230V AC to a usable DC voltage<br> • (RP-)SMA -
  SubMiniature version A, it's the main antenna connector we use on most stuff,
  default on goggles and nearly all BNF quads<br> • MMCX - Micro-miniature
  coaxial. Used by default on most VTXs as a smaller connector, needs to be
  adapted to SMA in most use cases<br> • IPEX/u.fl - Different manufacturer
  names for the same thing. Used on receivers, on really small VTXs, as well is
  internally in most radios<br> • Pigtail - Common name for any kind of cable
  adapter, like an XT60 with wires pre-soldered, or adapting from MMCX or
  IPEX/u.fl to SMA<br> • PDB - Power Distribution Board. These are outdated now,
  as we use 4in1 ESC boards. They were used in the past to route power to
  individual ESC boards, only still used in bigger applications and exotic
  setups<br>
