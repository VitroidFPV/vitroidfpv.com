  If you're only getting less than ~10m, even worse less than 1m of video range,
  these are often the main reasons:


  * **ABSOLUTELY** make sure that your VTX antenna is correctly installed. If not, you can *very* quickly fry the VTX. Make sure it's on correctly, and with the correct connector

  * Make sure you're on the correct frequency. You should be on the same band and channel as your VTX. This often occurs from incorrect behavior of the auto-search feature on goggles. Auto-search is not very reliable, it's always best to manually set the correct band and channel

  * The VTX may often be locked to 25mW for legal reasons. There are plenty of tutorials on how to unlock it to get a higher output power

  * The VTX can also be stuck in PIT mode (completely powered off, or transmitting at like 0.1mW). This can be changed with the hardware button on the VTX, or in Betaflight as well
