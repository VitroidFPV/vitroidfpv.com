  It all just depends on what you want to do. There are quads you can build
  ranging anywhere from a little thing that fits in your palm, and can be safely
  flown anywhere, to copters that can lift cinema-grade cameras and more. What
  you pick out depends on your needs and budget limits


  * If you just want to fly indoors safely when learning, a 65mm or 75mm tinywhoop is likely the best option while also being the cheapest

  * For general freestyle/race flying with a full GoPro, a 5" is the best all-round size with the most available components and guides

  * If don't need a full-size GoPro and use a smaller/lighter HD cam, or record DVR for footage sharing, you can go down to 3-4". good for both freestyle and non-spec racing while also being cheaper and easier to fly in more places

  * If you still want a gopro or a smaller/lighter action camera, but in a safer form, get a cinewhoop. From 2.5" to 3.5", they run protected blades to not damage anything in crashes. Safe to fly around people and other expensive objects

  * If you're going for flight time with no gopro, a 4" or 5" ultralite LR quad will do well. Can carry a smaller action cam, and fly for long periods of time


  ###### Now entering dangerous, hard to maintain/to fly drones, this should not be your first build.


  * For long flight time **with** a full GoPro, get a 7" LR quad. They can carry stupid big batteries, or go lighter to maintain high speeds, or carry a larger camera depending on your need

  * For carrying even larger cameras while keeping good maneuverability and speed, a cinelifter is the best pick. 4 large motors spinning bigger props, or 8 smaller props to generate enough thrust
