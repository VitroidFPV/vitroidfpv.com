  No matter if you are building a quad or getting one pre-made, you will need
  tools to fix it/actually build it. There are actual product recommendations
  elsewhere on the site if you want specific, this is just a general guide:


  #### Assembly:


  * 1.5, 2, and 2.5mm HEX drivers should be all  you need for M2/M3 screws that are most commonly used on most builds

  * A prop tool, socket wrench or a socket ratchet with an M5 bit for prop nuts

  * Not strictly necessary, but a silicon work mat. Even a cheap one will do, goes a long way to protect your work surface and keep track of your tools and screws

  * Tweezers or forceps, to hold small nuts/washers, or to hold wires when soldering. Speaking of...


  #### Soldering:


  * Obviously a soldering iron

  * A wet sponge, or a brass wool sponge to clean your soldering iron tip

  * Flux. Flux comes in a wide variety of application forms. As a gel in a small tub, a paste in a syringe, or liquid in flux pen, to protect the solder joints from oxidizing and make them easier to work

  * Solder, or tin. Usually 60/40 (63/37) tin-lead mix. Ideally rosin core, ~0.8mm thick

  * Helping hands or BluTac (or any generic sticky mounting putty) to hold the wires/PCB in place when soldering

  * Heatshrink and a lighter to insulate any wire connections
