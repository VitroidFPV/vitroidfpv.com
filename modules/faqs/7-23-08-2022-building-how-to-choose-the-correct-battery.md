title: How to choose the correct battery?

  There are a few recommended manufacturers, like CNHL, GNB, and Tattu (R-Line)
  for quads, as well as LG, Sony, Panasonic, and Samsung for 18650's. 


  For quads, they all have their pros and cons. CNHL are good performing and cheap, but at times heavier. GNB are likely the best performing batts without sacrificing durability, Tattu make a wide range of batteries, the R-Line series is most often used for lightweight quads for weight savings and very high performance, but they're expensive and fragile


  For the 18650 (or any other cylinder cell Li-Ion batteries), the four listed manufacturers are likely to perform about the same for their respective use (lower power, high capacity)


  As for selecting the capacity, it depends on the size and use of the craft. For a tinywhoop, you may pick around 250-350mAh for 2-3" micros about 350-550mAh. Going up in weight to a cinewhoop or a 4" quad, about 650-100mAh, 5" would be 1000-1500mAh, and going up in size the capacity starts to vary more and more. All of these should be kept to the cell count as well, for higher cell count you usually don't need too high of a capacity, 4s 5" is \~1500mAh, 6s \~1300mAh
