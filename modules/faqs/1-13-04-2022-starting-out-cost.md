  This all just depends on the budget that you have. FPV can get pretty
  expensive fast, so you should know what you're getting into. <br> A good rule
  of thumb is to not get anything you can't immediately afford to get
  replacement parts. <br><br>

  $20 - If you already have a game controller and a decent PC/Console, you can buy a sim and try flying to see if you'd enjoy FPV <br> $70-$100 - For this price you can get a hobby-grade radio, that will give you a much more realistic feel when flying in a simulator, and can be used if/when you decide to get a quad <br> $300-400 - Cheapest you can reasonably get flying for real. This will get you a whoop to fly indoors, a proper radio, and some budget goggles to start off <br> $500-600 - Cheapest you can get a 5" setup for. Same radio and goggles, but the quad will obviously be more epxensive <br> ~$700 - This is where I would aim for with a solid analog setup. You'd get good slimline goggles, a good charging setup and tools, and a proper quad <br> ~$800 - Pretty much the top end for analog as it gets, I wouldn't really go any further without going on DJI Digital <br> $1000+ - About the most you can reasonably spend. DJI FPV, and high end radio equipment
