  This can happen due to various reasons, here's a checklist you can run through
  if you're experiencing issues:


  * Make sure that you have a data cable. Some USB cables only carry power

  * Make sure that the wire is fully functional. Often the cheaper cables snap internally, only allowing a flaky connection at best

  * You'd be surprised how common this is. But only plug the USB cable into the flight controller. Likely culprits for confusion can be DJI Air units, but I've seen people plug in radios as well (for whatever reason), so don't feel bad if you don't find the correct port the first time

  * As for the PC side: If your PC doesn't even recognize that the FC is plugged in with a sound indication, try a different USB port

  * If that didn't work, you can try the [ImpulseRC Driver Fixer](https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads) tool to install all the needed drivers
