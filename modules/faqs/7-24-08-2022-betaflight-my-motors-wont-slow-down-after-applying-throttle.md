title: My motors won't slow down after applying throttle
id: iTerm
answer: This is normal, and it's called I Term Windup. Basically, the quad wants
  to have control over its movement at all times. When it can't move, it'll spin
  up the motors more and more to try to move. This is most often caused by the
  props not being on, so once you put them on correctly it will likely work as
  expected
