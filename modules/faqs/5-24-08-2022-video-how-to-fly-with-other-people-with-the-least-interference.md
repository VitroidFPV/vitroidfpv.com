  If you're just flying alone, blasting the highest output power on R8 is just
  fine. But say you want to go socialize with some other pilots once in a blue
  moon, others won't like you shooting down their video by powering on, blasting
  1.6W of video into the surrounding 5 channels. Here's how to avoid such
  situations:


  * Communication is key. Ask other pilots what frequency they're flying on, and even better, agree beforehand which frequency everyone will fly on to avoid confusion

  * Turn on pit mode and low power on power-on, so that even if you are on a channel that someone else is on, there is a small chance it will kick their video out of the air

  * Space out your frequencies, according to this chart:

    If you're flying with DJI pilots, get some distance between yourself. On analog this isn't an issue, but since DJI goggles transmit signals as well, it's good to be spaced out
