<Admonition type="info" title="Background">

So... let's start off with some background. FlyFish is a very new FPV
manufacturer, owned and ran by multiple different people from the FPV
industry, including IFlight

</Admonition>

The products they make (currently motors, antennas, and frames) are pretty good from everything I heard. A lot of amazing pilots that I know really like the motors, and had direct feedback when it came to making them. The antennas seem to be pretty average but not bad, and we can never have enough. Their frames are currently the newest options in their lineup, but similar to the motors, they are well-made and truly tested


# Flash motors


Coming in two color options, black & silver, and silver & purple. IMO a really nice niche to hit, both for people looking for stealth motors, as well as people looking to add a pop of color. Color variations of the silver ones are also planned, for blue and gold as the accents


They also offer replacement bells for every motor they sell, so you don't have to pay the full price if you just damage the bell. Though this is pretty unlikely, as they are pretty durable and run smoothly even after heavy crashes from what I heard. 


Currently offered sizes are:

# Volador frames


Slick aluminum-on-carbon frames with fancy colors, reasonable pricing, 3d milled carbon, and integrated XT60 holders

<Tablist>
<Tab tabTitle="Volador VX5/VD5" open>

Not your typical boxy frames, they have full 7075 aluminum cam cages for a really nice look and all-round camera protection, and durable T700 carbon. Coming in a Squash-X and Deadcat configurations for freestyle and cinematic uses. Heavier than usual, but with the thick carbon plates and 6mm arms that are extra thick in the center, it makes sense


Available options:


* [Volador VX5](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vx5-fpv-freestyle-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

* [Volador VD5](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vd5-deadcat-fpv-lr-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

<GridBox title="Specs" level={6}>

<GridItem title="Carbon Plates">

* 6mm arms

</GridItem>

<GridItem title="Sizing">

* Camera: 19x19 / 20x20
* Stack: 20x20/30x30 + 20x20/25x25
* Prop: 5.1"
* Wheelbase: 225mm

</GridItem>

<GridItem title="Weight">
199.5g VX5, 203.5g VD5 (including TPU parts)
</GridItem>

<GridItem title="Price">

* $64.90 black TPU

* $69.90 (nice) multicolor "Tropical mix" TPU

</GridItem>

</GridBox>

</Tab>

<Tab tabTitle="Volador VX6/VD6">

Very similar in principle to the 5" frames, but with longer 6" arms for mid-range shots, and/or for comfortably carrying slightly heavier cameras (think heavy GoPro 10/11). Could also use 5.5" props as a nice in-between, as the extra 1" of the arms does not add much weight


Available options:


* [Volador VX6](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vx6-fpv-freestyle-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

* [Volador VD6](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/frames/products/volador-vd6-deadcat-fpv-lr-t700-frame-kit) Black/Tropical Mix

# Osprey antennas


I mean they're antennas, not much to write about. I've asked around, and the omnis seem pretty durable. They come in multiple different lengths, sizes, polarizations and connectors for all of the different ways you'd want to mount them. They also have a DJI faceplate directional antenna for DJI FPV Goggles V1 and V2. All of their antennas are available [here](https://www.flyfish-rc.com/collections/antennas/fpv-antennas)
