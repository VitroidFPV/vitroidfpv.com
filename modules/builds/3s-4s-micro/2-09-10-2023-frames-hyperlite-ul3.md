text: The Hyperlite UL3 offers a lot of possibilities. It fits 20x and 25x
  stacks, has 9x and 12x motor mounts, and allows you to use a regular canopy or
  a more traditional standoff + top plate setup. The 3" version even fits 3.5"
  props, but it's available up to 5" as well for bigger ultralight builds
