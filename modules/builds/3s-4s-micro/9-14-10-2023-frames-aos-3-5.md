text: Chris Rosser has meticulously designed everything about the AOS frames to
  give you the best vibration/oscillation performance. Even at such a small
  scale, it can make a difference. If you like your blackbox especially clean,
  this is the frame to go with. Great for smooth O3 recordings as well
