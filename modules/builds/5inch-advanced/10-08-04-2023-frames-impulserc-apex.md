text: This has been a staple of freestyle frames for a very long time, and it
  holds up incredibly well after all those days. It seems that ImpulseRC made it
  perform as well as it does almost by mistake, as the techniques weren't as
  developed back then. Regardless, it's a great option for an all-round build
