text: Axis has one pretty unique thing common across all of their frames from 7"
  down to this 3.5" guy - using machined metal plates holding the arms. This
  offers rigidity and ease of removal, at the cost of some weight.  The metal
  continues to the cam cage, where you even have a printed cam angle gauge
