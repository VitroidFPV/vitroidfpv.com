text: The Lil' Matey is meant to be decently tanky, but it's also running the
  arms in a deadcat configuration, so your HD camera shouldn't see any props in
  the recording. With the option to run the battery rotated 90°  for a "toilet
  tank" configuration as well, it's a very versatile frame. Watch out for the
  Torx bolts though!
