text: The V1 used to be the best budget option for a while, about the cheapest
  you could've gotten a multiprotocol radio. It got hard to find as Jumper
  discontinued it a while back, but now it's back! Still IMO the cheapest way to
  get an ok ELRS radio nowadays, though lacking slightly in the power output
price: $72.50/84.50
